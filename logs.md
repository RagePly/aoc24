## Solution: Day 2 (`git diff 709d1be`)

A bad run, the server lagged temporarily and I then used an invalid link
for some time which cost a few minutes. I also (re-)defined a variable inside
a loop, why can't python have scoped variables??? The second part went
awful for the simple reason that I could not come up with a simple strategy
and rewrote it 3 times and in that process messed up the logic borrowed
from part 1. I allways got the same answer as the test-input as well which
misled me for a while. Next day will be better.

## Solution: day 1 (`git diff 57ec9e8`)

First part went very well, but I messed up on the last part by not
reading the entire problem spec and missed the "multiply by the value"
part and did therefore not get a good position in the end.
